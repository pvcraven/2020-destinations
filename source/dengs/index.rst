Best Dishes
-----------

**Chow Mein**

*Deng's offers a variety of chow mein dishes including vegetable, chicken, 
beef, pork, and shrimp. These all come with exclusive flavors and perfectly
textured, home-cooked noodles. The calories are conservative on this dish as
well so it's great for a diet meal.*

**Kung Pao**

*Deng's kung pao dishes have the perfect amount of spice. They aren't too hot
and are a bit sweet. They offer kung pao chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, and a 
triple d'lite that offers a combination.*

**Mongolian**

*I would personally consider Deng's Mongolian dishes their signature. The 
flavor in these is not seen at any other Chinese restaurant in Iowa. They
only offer Mongolian chicken and beef but those 2 dishes do not disappoint.*

Prices
------

**Lunch Special 11:00am to 3:00pm**

The main courses range from $7.45 to $7.95 with the option to add a vegetable for $2.00, add meat for $3.00 and add mixed vegetables for $3.00.

*To put this in perspective for Simpson students a 24oz smoothie at the Kent Campus Center costs the same as a whole meal at Deng's.*
