The Local Vine
==============

Welcome to *The Local Vine* information page!

Owners of The Local Vine are husband and wife duo, Andrea and Dan Palmer.
They decided to pursue their dream of being restaurant owners in 2016 and 
opened their doors for opening day on Nov. 1st, 2017. 

The restaurant is home to an extensive beverage list but are known best 
for their in and out of state wine collection.  Along with wine, they serve 
ales, lagers and hard ciders in addition to a lineup of traditional domestic 
beers. If you are interested in non alcoholic beverages, there is coffee, 
espresso drinks, tea, juice, soda, and smoothies. 

The restaurant also serves up light snacks such as,  sandwiches,
soups, flat breads and desserts. 


The Local Vine is in a great location at the center of the town,
on the square, and within walking distance from Simpson College.
Owner Andrea notes that "being so close to campus gives us an awesome 
opportunity to be a go to place for them". Andrea also mentioned that when 
deciding what their hours should be, Dan and her both agreed to stay open later
so students could come in. Not just for the purpose of a drink or snack, but 
for studying space. Understanding the underwhelming spaces to do work after
7:00 in Indianola, is essential to appreciate *The Local Vine's* hours.
