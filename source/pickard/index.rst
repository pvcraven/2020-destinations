History
-------
The Clarence Pickard family bought the land in 1976. It was originally a farm that was transformed into the park it is today. The man-made hillsides was done by the Soil Conversation Service in Warren Country. Pickard park is known to have some of the first terrances and water diversion projects that were completed.

   Baseball Game [#f1]_ 

The **Indianola Park and Rec Youth and Adult Softball Teams** reserve the fields for practice times at coach and manager meetings. Any **Independent Competitive Softball and Baseball Teams** can equally reserve practice time after the Parks and Rec teams reserve their times. Usually there is a meeting to sort out the feild times and reservations. This can happen between April and June and, again, between July and September. 

However, there are qualifications to reserve the fields:

* 75% of team must attend Indianola Schools
* Must submit a rost with names and info of all the coaches and players
* Pay in advance for reservations
   * $10 per 75-minute practice time

If the **Indianola Little League Baseball Teams** or anyone else wants to reserve a field, they must call one week in advance and the fee must be paid at that time

.. _Crosscountry:

Cross Country
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Pickard Park** has a 1-mile Terrace Trail and a 2-mile Pond & Prairie trail, mowed and marked trail loops that starts near the shelter. These loops and land is very commonly used for Cross Country meets hosted by Indianola Schools and Simpson College. The **McVay Trail** is a 1.6 mile paved route that can take you to **Pickard Park**.

.. _Discgolf:
