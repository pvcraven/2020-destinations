Pete's Pizza
============

A local hole in the wall pizza dive bar, located on the town square. 
This is a great place for a quick slice with the family or grabbing a 
beer with your friends! We have a variety of pizza, which are fantastic 
and made from scratch every day.  

Pete’s has been around for many years and we pride ourselves on our 
relationship with our customers! We have an arcade room for all ages, 
TV’s to watch the game, and high-top bar in the middle of the restaurant! 
It is a very fun environment for all!

Recent Updates
--------------

With in the past physical year there was ownership change with in Pete's. What 
does this change mean for Pete's future? After the opportunity of sitting down
with new owner, previous manager, and talking to her about the direction she 
sees Pete's going. She mentioned adding deals, making monthly specialty pizzas,
student deals, and potentially changing hours slightly to keep it open longer.
Already with the change in ownership I, a frequent flyer at Pete's have noticed 
more consistent hours. In previous years, I have visited Pete's during listed 
hours and walked home several times because they did not open.
