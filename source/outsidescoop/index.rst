Specialty Flavors
-----------------

**Raspberry Sorbet** 

*This unique flavor offers an enriching experience for your taste buds. It melts in your on contact making you feel like you just ate a handful of raspberries. It is also one of many vegan flavors.*

**Salted White Chocolate Caramel Cashew**

*This combination of sweets makes for a great post-test treat. You can immediately taste the carmel and as it melts you get that sense of white chocolate, finally chewing on the salted cashews.*

**Elvis' Peanut Butter Banana Bacon**

*Now this flavor is a make or break situation. Nobody thinks it is just alright, they either love it or will never order it again. Bacon, banana, and peanut butter can mix like rice and chicken for people. It is one of the most powerful tasting flavors on the menu.*
